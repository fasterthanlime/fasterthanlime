Hi! I'm Amos Wenger, better known as fasterthanlime around the web.

As of November of 2022, [writing in-depth articles](https://fasterthanli.me) and [making videos](https://youtube.com/@fasterthanlime) is my full-time occupation.

Before I did this, I worked at companies including itch.io, netlify, and fly.io.

In a previous life, I worked on cool stuff like [an MP3 decoder in the
browser](https://github.com/audiocogs/jsmad) (that was before emscripten), the
[itch.io desktop app](https://itch.io/app) (it used to work!), I even made [my
own programming language, ooc](https://github.com/ooc-lang/rock) way back when.

In my current life, I _still_ work on cool stuff, like series about:

  * [Reading files the hard way](https://fasterthanli.me/series/reading-files-the-hard-way)
  * [Building a Rust service with nix](https://fasterthanli.me/series/building-a-rust-service-with-nix)

And also videos like:

  * [Let's make an htop-like in your browser (with Rust)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_5Jy_AVDaM)
  * [strace feels like magic â€” let's fix that (with Rust)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=engduNoI6DE)
